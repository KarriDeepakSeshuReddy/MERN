DataBase : A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed,managed,updated

Types of Databases?
databases are primarily two Types
1.Relational Databases(SQL)
    stored data in tables (rows and coloumns)
    tables can be related using keys
    use SQL to manage data
    eg = MySQL , portgreSQL ,  SQLite , microsoft SQL server
2.Non-Relational Databases(NoSQL)
    stored data in JSON-like documnents,key-value pairs, graphs etc

Data is stored in tables(like Excel spreadsheets)

1. Relational Databases
Data Is stored in tables (lIke Excel spreadsheets)
Tables with defined schema
* Strong ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
* Ideal for:
* Financial systems
* Inventory systems
* Applications needing complex JOINs
Important Concepts:
* Primary Key
* Foreign Key
* Normalization
* Relationships: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many Pros:
* Strong data consistency
* Powerful querying with SOL
* Good for complex relationships
Cons:
* Rigid schema
* Scaling horizontally Is harder
2. Non-Relational Databases?
Data is stored in flexible formats, most commonly documents (lIke JSON).

Atomicity: All or Nothing
if A is transfering Rs2000 to B 
there are 3 steps involved in it
1. ammount check of a
2.Ammount Deduct from a
3.Ammount credit of B
